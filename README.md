# Before you Begin

Harness Feature Flags (FF) is a feature management solution that enables users to change the softwareâ€™s functionality, without deploying new code. FF uses feature flags to hide code or behaviours without having to ship new versions of the software. A feature flag is like a powerful if statement.

This is a sample app demonstrating APEX Server SDK integration with Feature Flags.

## Requirements
[SalesForce SFDX cli](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli)

## To use this application, follow the steps as below ##

1) Create a project in Harness with Feature-flags module enabled
2) Create an environment within your project
3) Create a client-side sdk key in your environment **COPY the value from the Admin Console to your clipboard since this value will only be displayed once**
4) Create a boolean feature-flag in the admin console
5) Replace the values for SDK Key and feature-flag identifier in the example program from step 3 and 4
6) Run the program from SalesForce DEV console

## Build instructions

1. Clone the Apex SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harness/ff-apex-server-sdk
```

2. Deploy the SDK to Salesforce.

```bash
cd apex-server-sdk
sfdx force:source:deploy --targetusername='YOUR TARGET ORG' --sourcepath='force-app'
```

3. If there is an existing boolean feature flag in your project that you want to evaluate, edit `sample.apex` and set the value of `flag` to the flag key.

```java
String flag = 'bool-flag';
```

4. Use the SDK with `sample.apex`

```bash
sfdx force:apex:execute --targetusername='YOUR TARGET ORG' --apexcodefile='sample.apex'
```
